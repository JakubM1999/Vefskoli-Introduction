                <p>So my name is Jakub Mierzejek. I was born in Poland year 1999 in a small city named Szczytno,
                    after kindergarten me and my famly moved to England and we lived in London for a while then moved
                    to a smaller city. After that we got a opertunity in Iceland so moved there for 4 years. </p>
                <p>We went back to Poland for 2 years and finally figured it out that Iceland is our home and we
                    wanted to stay. I was around 13 or 14 at that time. I got older finished my graphic designer degree,
                    started seeing the most beautilful and wonderful women of my life thet i have known since i was 9 years
                    old and proposed to her (Best day of my life). She moved in with me and after a year we desided that I
                    should go back to school again.

        <p class="section__subtitle">This is some of my work that I am very proud of. I made this in Adobe Illustrator by using drawing pad.
            
            <li class="work__list">Spider-man: this was my very first digital drawing and i think it went pretty good. This drawing 
                 was made for my graduation magazine in graphic desing.</li>
            
            <li class="work__list">Batman: That was my second drawing witch I needed for my magazine, so I thought "who is the 
                 second most popular superhero and it was Batman.</li>

            <li class="work__list">Sonic: Now Sonic was made a little later when i ws looking for a job and I needed something more
                 for my portfolio. I took my time with this one and it was worth it because i consider that one 
                 the best so far.
